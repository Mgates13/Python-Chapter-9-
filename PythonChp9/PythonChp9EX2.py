#Python Chapter 9 Exercise 2
#Morgan Gates 
#Exercise 2: Write a program that categorizes each mail message by which day of the week the commit was done. 
#To do this look for lines that start with "From", then look for the third word and keep a running count of each of the days of the week. 
#At the end of the program print out the contents of your dictionary (order does not matter).
